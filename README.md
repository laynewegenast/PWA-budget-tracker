 ## Description
 This is a project that allows the user to track expenses using a add-subtract simple format which is then displayed on a graph. This application works both online and offline, and when transaction are posted offline they are stored for when the application is again connected to a network. Past transactions are also visible when using the application off network. 

 After downloading the starter code, I was able to create the manifest.json, idb.js, and the service-worker.js files to begin this activity. 

 ## Installation
 Run npm install to obtain the following necessary packages for this application:
  "dependencies": {
    "compression": "^1.7.4",
    "express": "^4.17.1",
    "mongoose": "^5.5.15",
    "morgan": "^1.9.1"
  }

 ## Usage
 User will utilize the deployed heroku link to track expenses with or without network conntection. If installed onto a local device, the user may run npm start in the root project terminal and may use the Chrome Tools featured to manipulate an network or offline connection to test the effectivness of this application.
